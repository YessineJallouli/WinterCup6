#### Balanced Problemset :

Winter Cup is always a very special event. However, this year's edition is even more special for the Vertex Cover team as it marks their third and last time as problemsetters at the prestigious contest. Therefore, the team has decided to provide the highest quality problemset of all-time. The team has $N$ problems where the $i$th problem has difficulty $D_{i}$. Oussama thinks the problemset isn't balanced. He believes that in a balanced problemset the difference between the hardest problem and the easiest problem shouldn't be very large. To balance the problemset, he decided to create an easy version and a hard version for every problem. The easy version of problem $i$ has difficulty $D_{i}$ - $K$ while the hard version has difficulty $D_{i}$ + $K$.

He will replace **every problem** with its easy version or its hard version. He will do this in order to minimize the difficulty difference between the easiest and hardest problem.
Help Oussama prepare the problemset.

**Input**

The first line in the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$  $(2 \le  $N$ , $K$  \le 10^{5})$

The second line contains $N$ integer $D_{i}$ â€” the original difficulty of problem $i$

**Output**

Print the smallest possible difference of difficulty
