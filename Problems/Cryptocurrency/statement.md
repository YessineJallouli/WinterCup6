#### Cryptocurrency :

Many of you know Yessine, but very few know that he is a very successful entrepreneur. In fact, he founded his start-up *Iceberg Corporation* specialized in cryptocurrency a few years ago. He is currently a millionaire but he keeps going to INSAT so he can compete at the ICPC regionals.

As time went, Yessine's schedule has got really busy so he decided to hire his first employee. He hired his friend Oussama to do the job of a software engineer, a data scientist and a business analyst while paying him minimal wage. Oussama was very motivated to work so he didn't care about the money, he just wanted to solve hard problems. One time he was analyzing the evaluation of cryptocurrency market and came across the following problem:

Given a sequence $A$ of $N$ numbers denoting the prices of a certain cryptocurrency over a period of time, find the highest contiguous increase in price (HCI) . The HCI is the largest possible difference between the first and last element over all contiguous non-decreasing subsequences.

* A contiguous subsequence $A_{i}, A_{i+1},A_{i+2},\dots,A_j$ is a non-decreasing sequence if it satisfies $A_i \le A_{i+1} \le A_{i+2} \le ... \le A_j$

Can you solve this problem ?

**Input**

The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1\le N \le10^5$)  denoting the length of the sequence

The second line contains $N$ integers denoting the sequence $A$ ($1 \le A_i \le 10^9)$

**Output**

Print the highest contiguous increase of the cryptocurrency
