#### Iceberg Corporation :

Many of you know Yessine, but very few of you know that he is a very successful entrepreneur. In fact, he founded his start-up *Iceberg Corporation* specialized in cryptocurrency back in 2021. He is currently a millionaire but he keeps going to INSAT so he can compete at the ICPC regionals.

Anyway, *Iceberg Corporation* grew significantly so bought a big office and hired his two friends Rami and Oussama to help him. The three of them would meet every evening (because none of them would wake up in the morning) and they would work together. Everything was perfect, *except for one thing*. Sometimes, Rami and Yessine will make a Shisha and start smoking in the office. Oussama doesn't really like smoking so he decided to stop them.

Rami has brought K pieces of charcoil and left them at the office. Oussama decided to hide them. The office is a $N$*$M$ grid. Oussama will hide a single piece in a grid cell. However, he won't hide them at random spots. Instead, he will hide a piece in a cell if has the maximum sum of Manhattan distances from all the other cells in the grid.

Formally, he wants to maximize :

$\sum\limits_{i=1}^N$​ $\sum\limits_{j=1}^M$​ $\sum\limits_{k=1}^K$ $D$($i$,$j$,$k$)  where $D$($i$,$j$,$k$) denotes the Manhattan distance between cell ($i$,$j$) and the $k$th piece.

Help Oussama before his lungs get sick.

**Input**

The first and only line contains three integers $N$, $M$, $K$  $(1 \le  $$N$,$M$,$K$$  \le 10^{6})$

**Output**

Print the maximum possible sum
